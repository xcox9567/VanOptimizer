# VanOptimizer

This python program makes use of Gurobi optimizer to seperate a list of people into groups based off of their responses to a set of "yes" or "no" survey questions.

I created this program in order to create van rosters for my college frisbee team's tournament trips, and for this purpose the groups are set to be of size less than or equal to 6.  However the program can be utilized for a variety of purposes, and its hyperparameters such as the max group sizes are easily tweaked.
